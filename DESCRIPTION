Description: AquaFlux is an open-source R package designed to efficiently process and analyze TDP data.  
            AquaFlux can continually import raw TDP values with flexible formatting and alerts the user of 
            malfunctioning sensors, thus optimizing data collection.  Post-processing analysis addresses 
            gapfilling, radial trends, and rescaling.   To ensure reproducibility and transparency, all 
            user decisions are automatically documented, highlighting the impact of the userâ€™s decisions.
